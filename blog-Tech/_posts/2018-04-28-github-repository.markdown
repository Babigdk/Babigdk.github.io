- **Field Exposure:** One of the most engaging aspects of the event was the field exposure. Interns had the opportunity to witness M&E practices in action. Visits to ongoing projects allowed us to observe data collection, analysis, and reporting in real-time.

- **Technical Discussions:** The event also facilitated technical discussions on challenges and best practices in M&E. Experts shared insights into data validation, indicator selection, and effective reporting strategies. These discussions greatly enhanced our understanding of the complexities involved.

## Key Takeaways

From the Monitoring and Evaluation meeting session, I gained several key takeaways:
