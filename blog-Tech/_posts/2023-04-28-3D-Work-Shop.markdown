# Participation in 3D Printer and Design Program.

From March 6th to 10th, 2023. I had the privilege of representing Yobe State in an exceptional program organized by Woodlab and Devlap in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian and Disaster Management, powered by JICA. The program focused on 3D printing, design, and robotics and took place at Woodlab in Abuja.

## Overview of the Program

The program was a collaborative initiative aimed at enhancing technological skills and innovation in the field of 3D printing, design, and robotics. It brought together representatives from the northeast region of Nigeria, including Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Gombe, Bauchi, and Taraba. Each state was represented by a single participant, and I had the honor of representing Yobe State.

## Distinguished Guests and Speakers

The program was graced by the presence of distinguished guests, including an Ambassador of Japan and the Permanent Secretary for the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian and Disaster Management. Their participation highlighted the importance and significance of the program in promoting technological advancement and disaster management solutions in the region.

## Program Highlights

### 3D Printing and Design Workshops

Throughout the program, we engaged in comprehensive workshops on 3D printing and design. We learned about the principles of 3D printing technology, design software, and the application of these technologies in various industries, including disaster management and humanitarian aid.

### Robotics Sessions

The robotics sessions were a standout feature of the program. We explored the fundamentals of robotics, including programming and building basic robotic systems. These sessions provided insights into the potential of robotics in addressing real-world challenges.

## Collaborative Learning Environment

The program fostered a collaborative and supportive learning environment. Participants from diverse backgrounds shared their experiences and knowledge, enriching the overall learning experience. The interactive sessions allowed us to engage in discussions, brainstorming, and hands-on activities.

## Conclusion

Participating in the 3D Printer and Design program organized by Woodlab and Devlap, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian and Disaster Management and powered by JICA, was an enlightening experience. The knowledge gained during this program will undoubtedly contribute to my personal and professional growth, and the collaboration with representatives from other northeastern states has expanded my perspective on technology's potential for positive change.
